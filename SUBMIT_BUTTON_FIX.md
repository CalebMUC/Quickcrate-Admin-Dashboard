## Debug Features Added

### Development Mode Debug Panel

- Console logging of form state

### Form State Monitoring
- Real-time validation with `mode: "onChange"`
- Proper error state tracking
- Visual feedback for form validity

## What Should Work Now

### Submit Button Behavior
The "Next: Payment Information" button should now:
1. Be **disabled** when form is invalid (red ❌)
2. Be **enabled** when all required fields are filled correctly (green ✅)
3. Show validation errors immediately as user types
4. Display required field indicators with red asterisks (*)

### Required Fields to Fill
To enable the submit button, user must fill:
1. **Business Name** - At least 2 characters
2. **Business Type** - Select from dropdown
3. **Business Registration No.** - Any non-empty value
4. **KRA PIN** - Any non-empty value
5. **Business Nature** - Any non-empty description
6. **Business Category** - Select from dropdown
7. **Delivery Method** - Select from dropdown

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Form Validation
```
1. Open merchant registration wizard
2. Navigate to Business Information step
3. Check that submit button is initially disabled
4. Fill each required field one by one
5. Verify button becomes enabled when all fields are valid
6. Test with invalid data to ensure validation works
```

### 2. Check Debug Information
```
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Business Form Debug" logs
3. Check the debug panel in the form
4. Verify form state changes as you type
```

### 3. Test Complete Flow
```
1. Complete Contact step
2. Complete Business step (should now work)
3. Complete Payment step
4. Complete Documents step
5. Review and submit
```
